description: '''The Duchess of Padua'', written in 1883, is a tragic melodrama that
  centres around a young man named Guido Ferranti who has come to Padua to learn the
  secret of his birth. There he is told that his father''s life was ruined by the
  current duke of Padua; Guido is convinced that he should revenge his father''s life
  by murdering the duke. He agrees at first to undertake this mission, but later balks
