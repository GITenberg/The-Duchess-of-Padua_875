<h2>ACT I</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">SCENE</p>
<p><i>The Market Place of Padua at noon</i>; <i>in the background
is the great Cathedral of Padua</i>; <i>the architecture is
Romanesque</i>, <i>and wrought in black and white marbles</i>;
<i>a flight of marble steps leads up to the Cathedral door</i>;
<i>at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions</i>; <i>the
houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
windows</i>, <i>and are flanked by stone arcades</i>; <i>on the
right of the stage is the public fountain</i>, <i>with a triton
in green bronze blowing from a conch</i>; <i>around the fountain
is a stone seat</i>; <i>the bell of the Cathedral is ringing</i>,
<i>and the citizens</i>, <i>men</i>, <i>women and children</i>,
<i>are passing into the Cathedral</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Guido Ferranti</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ascanio Cristofano</span>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther;
for if I walk another step I will have no life left to swear by;
this wild-goose errand of yours!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Sits down on the step of the
fountain</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I think it must be here.&nbsp; [<i>Goes up to
passer-by and doffs his cap</i>.]&nbsp; Pray, sir, is this the
market place, and that the church of Santa Croce?&nbsp;
[<i>Citizen bows</i>.]&nbsp; I thank you, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay! it is here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I would it were somewhere else, for I see no
wine-shop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">[<i>Taking a letter from his pocket and reading
it</i>.]&nbsp; &lsquo;The hour noon; the city, Padua; the place,
the market; and the day, Saint Philip&rsquo;s Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>reading still</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;I will wear a violet cloak with a silver
falcon broidered on the shoulder.&rsquo;&nbsp; A brave attire,
Ascanio.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;d sooner have my leathern jerkin.&nbsp;
And you think he will tell you of your father?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Why, yes!&nbsp; It is a month ago now, you
remember; I was in the vineyard, just at the corner nearest the
road, where the goats used to get in, a man rode up and asked me
was my name Guido, and gave me this letter, signed &lsquo;Your
Father&rsquo;s Friend,&rsquo; bidding me be here to-day if I
would know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to
recognise the writer!&nbsp; I had always thought old Pedro was my
uncle, but he told me that he was not, but that I had been left a
child in his charge by some one he had never since seen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And you don&rsquo;t know who your father
is?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No recollection of him even?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">None, Ascanio, none.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span> [<i>laughing</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he could never have boxed your ears so
often as my father did mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>smiling</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">I am sure you never deserved it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Never; and that made it worse.&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t the consciousness of guilt to buoy me up.&nbsp; What
hour did you say he fixed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Noon.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Clock in the Cathedral
strikes</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">It is that now, and your man has not
come.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe in him, Guido.&nbsp; I think it
is some wench who has set her eye at you; and, as I have followed
you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you shall follow me to the
nearest tavern.&nbsp; [<i>Rises</i>.]&nbsp; By the great gods of
eating, Guido, I am as hungry as a widow is for a husband, as
tired as a young maid is of good advice, and as dry as a
monk&rsquo;s sermon.&nbsp; Come, Guido, you stand there looking
at nothing, like the fool who tried to look into his own mind;
your man will not come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well, I suppose you are right.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp;
[<i>Just as he is leaving the stage with</i> <span
class="smcap">Ascanio</span>, <i>enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Moranzone</span> <i>in a violet cloak</i>,
<i>with a silver falcon broidered on the shoulder</i>; <i>he
passes across to the Cathedral</i>, <i>and just as he is going
in</i> <span class="smcap">Guido</span> <i>runs up and touches
him</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">What!&nbsp; Does my father live?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay! lives in thee.<br />
Thou art the same in mould and lineament,<br />
Carriage and form, and outward semblances;<br />
I trust thou art in noble mind the same.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived<br />
But for this moment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">We must be alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">This is my dearest friend, who out of love<br
/>
Has followed me to Padua; as two brothers,<br />
There is no secret which we do not share.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">There is one secret which ye shall not
share;<br />
Bid him go hence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Ascanio</span>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Come back within the hour.<br />
He does not know that nothing in this world<br />
Can dim the perfect mirror of our love.<br />
Within the hour come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ascanio</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Speak not to him,<br />
There is a dreadful terror in his look.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>laughing</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to
tell<br />
That I am some great Lord of Italy,<br />
And we will have long days of joy together.<br />
Within the hour, dear Ascanio.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit</i> <span
class="smcap">Ascanio</span>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Now tell me of my father?&nbsp; [<i>Sits down
on a stone seat</i>.]<br />
Stood he tall?<br />
I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.<br />
His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold,<br />
Like a red fire of gold?&nbsp; Was his voice low?<br />
The very bravest men have voices sometimes<br />
Full of low music; or a clarion was it<br />
That brake with terror all his enemies?<br />
Did he ride singly? or with many squires<br />
And valiant gentlemen to serve his state?<br />
For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins<br />
Beat with the blood of kings.&nbsp; Was he a king?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>proudly</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Then when you saw my noble father last<br />
He was set high above the heads of men?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay, he was high above the heads of men,</p>
<p>[<i>Walks over to</i> <span class="smcap">Guido</span> <i>and
puts his hand upon his shoulder</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">On a red scaffold, with a butcher&rsquo;s
block<br />
Set for his neck.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>leaping up</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">What dreadful man art thou,<br />
That like a raven, or the midnight owl,<br />
Com&rsquo;st with this awful message from the grave?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I am known here as the Count Moranzone,<br />
Lord of a barren castle on a rock,<br />
With a few acres of unkindly land<br />
And six not thrifty servants.&nbsp; But I was one<br />
Of Parma&rsquo;s noblest princes; more than that,<br />
I was your father&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>clasping his
hand</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Tell me of him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo,<br
/>
He was the Prince of Parma, and the Duke<br />
Of all the fair domains of Lombardy<br />
Down to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even<br />
Was wont to pay him tribute&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Come to his death.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You will hear that soon enough.&nbsp; Being at
war&mdash;<br />
O noble lion of war, that would not suffer<br />
Injustice done in Italy!&mdash;he led<br />
The very flower of chivalry against<br />
That foul adulterous Lord of Rimini,<br />
Giovanni Malatesta&mdash;whom God curse!<br />
And was by him in treacherous ambush taken,<br />
And like a villain, or a low-born knave,<br />
Was by him on the public scaffold murdered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>clutching his
dagger</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Doth Malatesta live?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No, he is dead.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Did you say dead?&nbsp; O too swift runner,
Death,<br />
Couldst thou not wait for me a little space,<br />
And I had done thy bidding!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span> [<i>clutching his
wrist</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou canst do it!<br />
The man who sold thy father is alive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Sold! was my father sold?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay! trafficked for,<br />
Like a vile chattel, for a price betrayed,<br />
Bartered and bargained for in privy market<br />
By one whom he had held his perfect friend,<br />
One he had trusted, one he had well loved,<br />
One whom by ties of kindness he had bound&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And he lives<br />
Who sold my father?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I will bring you to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">So, Judas, thou art living! well, I will
make<br />
This world thy field of blood, so buy it straight-way,<br />
For thou must hang there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Judas said you, boy?<br />
Yes, Judas in his treachery, but still<br />
He was more wise than Judas was, and held<br />
Those thirty silver pieces not enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">What got he for my father&rsquo;s blood?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">What got he?<br />
Why cities, fiefs, and principalities,<br />
Vineyards, and lands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Of which he shall but keep<br />
Six feet of ground to rot in.&nbsp; Where is he,<br />
This damned villain, this foul devil? where?<br />
Show me the man, and come he cased in steel,<br />
In complete panoply and pride of war,<br />
Ay, guarded by a thousand men-at-arms,<br />
Yet I shall reach him through their spears, and feel<br />
The last black drop of blood from his black heart<br />
Crawl down my blade.&nbsp; Show me the man, I say,<br />
And I will kill him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span> [<i>coldly</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Fool, what revenge is there?<br />
Death is the common heritage of all,<br />
And death comes best when it comes suddenly.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Goes up close to</i> <span
class="smcap">Guido</span>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Your father was betrayed, there is your cue;<br
/>
For you shall sell the seller in his turn.<br />
I will make you of his household, you shall sit<br />
At the same board with him, eat of his bread&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">O bitter bread!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy palate is too nice,<br />
Revenge will make it sweet.&nbsp; Thou shalt o&rsquo; nights<br
/>
Pledge him in wine, drink from his cup, and be<br />
His intimate, so he will fawn on thee,<br />
Love thee, and trust thee in all secret things.<br />
If he bid thee be merry thou must laugh,<br />
And if it be his humour to be sad<br />
Thou shalt don sables.&nbsp; Then when the time is
ripe&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<span class="smcap">Guido</span>
<i>clutches his sword</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, nay, I trust thee not; your hot young
blood,<br />
Undisciplined nature, and too violent rage<br />
Will never tarry for this great revenge,<br />
But wreck itself on passion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thou knowest me not.<br />
Tell me the man, and I in everything<br />
Will do thy bidding.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well, when the time is ripe,<br />
The victim trusting and the occasion sure,<br />
I will by sudden secret messenger<br />
Send thee a sign.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">How shall I kill him, tell me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">That night thou shalt creep into his private
chamber;<br />
But if he sleep see that thou wake him first,<br />
And hold thy hand upon his throat, ay! that way,<br />
Then having told him of what blood thou art,<br />
Sprung from what father, and for what revenge,<br />
Bid him to pray for mercy; when he prays,<br />
Bid him to set a price upon his life,<br />
And when he strips himself of all his gold<br />
Tell him thou needest not gold, and hast not mercy,<br />
And do thy business straight away.&nbsp; Swear to me<br />
Thou wilt not kill him till I bid thee do it,<br />
Or else I go to mine own house, and leave<br />
Thee ignorant, and thy father unavenged.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Now by my father&rsquo;s sword&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">The common hangman<br />
Brake that in sunder in the public square.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Then by my father&rsquo;s grave&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">What grave? what grave?<br />
Your noble father lieth in no grave,<br />
I saw his dust strewn on the air, his ashes<br />
Whirled through the windy streets like common straws<br />
To plague a beggar&rsquo;s eyesight, and his head,<br />
That gentle head, set on the prison spike,<br />
For the vile rabble in their insolence<br />
To shoot their tongues at.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Was it so indeed?<br />
Then by my father&rsquo;s spotless memory,<br />
And by the shameful manner of his death,<br />
And by the base betrayal by his friend,<br />
For these at least remain, by these I swear<br />
I will not lay my hand upon his life<br />
Until you bid me, then&mdash;God help his soul,<br />
For he shall die as never dog died yet.<br />
And now, the sign, what is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">This dagger, boy;<br />
It was your father&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, let me look at it!<br />
I do remember now my reputed uncle,<br />
That good old husbandman I left at home,<br />
Told me a cloak wrapped round me when a babe<br />
Bare too such yellow leopards wrought in gold;<br />
I like them best in steel, as they are here,<br />
They suit my purpose better.&nbsp; Tell me, sir,<br />
Have you no message from my father to me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Poor boy, you never saw that noble father,<br
/>
For when by his false friend he had been sold,<br />
Alone of all his gentlemen I escaped<br />
To bear the news to Parma to the Duchess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Speak to me of my mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moranzone</span></p>
<p class="poetry">When thy mother<br />
Heard my black news, she fell into a swoon,<br />
And, being with untimely travail seized&mdash;<br />
Bare thee into the world before thy time,<br />
And then her soul went heavenward, to wait<br />
Thy father, at the gates of Paradise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">A mother dead, a father sold and bartered!<br
/>

Like all true lovers: Oh, I have done the tricks!<br />
I know the partings and the chamberings;<br />
We are all animals at best, and love<br />
Is merely passion with a holy name.</p>

Love is the sacrament of life; it sets<br />
Virtue where virtue was not; cleanses men<br />
Of all the vile pollutions of this world;<br />
It is the fire which purges gold from dross,<br />
It is the fan which winnows wheat from chaff,<br />
It is the spring which in some wintry soil<br />
Makes innocence to blossom like a rose.<br />
The days are over when God walked with men,<br />
But Love, which is his image, holds his place.<br />
When a man loves a woman, then he knows<br />
God&rsquo;s secret, and the secret of the world.<br />
There is no house so lowly or so mean,<br />
Which, if their hearts be pure who live in it,<br />
Love will not enter; but if bloody murder<br />
Knock at the Palace gate and is let in,<br />
Love like a wounded thing creeps out and dies.<br />
This is the punishment God sets on sin.<br />
The wicked cannot love.</p>

Do you not hear?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas nothing.<br />
So I think<br />
That it is woman&rsquo;s mission by their love<br />
To save the souls of men: and loving her,<br />
My Lady, my white Beatrice, I begin<br />
To see a nobler and a holier vengeance<br />
In letting this man live, than doth reside<br />
In bloody deeds o&rsquo; night, stabs in the dark,<br />
And young hands clutching at a palsied throat.<br />
It was, I think, for love&rsquo;s sake that Lord Christ,<br />

The old man sleeping, full of years and sin;<br />
There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,<br />

Suddenly like a flame there flashed across me,<br />
There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:<br />
You said there lay a barrier between us,<br />

I hardly know<br />
What happened, but a steaming mist of blood<br />
Rose up between us two.</p>

In a coarse revel, or a tavern brawl,<br />
And reeling home late on the Saturday night,<br />
Finds his wife sitting by a fireless hearth,<br />
Trying to hush the child who cries for hunger,<br />
And then sets to and beats his wife because<br />
The child is hungry, and the fire black.<br />
Yet the wife loves him! and will rise next day<br />
With some red bruise across a careworn face,<br />
And sweep the house, and do the common service,<br />
And try and smile, and only be too glad<br />

Night lit her candles for me, and I saw<br />
The man I hated, cursing in his sleep;<br />

Poor boy: what if I kissed him?<br />
No, no, my lips would burn him like a fire.<br />
He has had enough of Love.&nbsp; Still that white neck<br />
Will &rsquo;scape the headsman: I have seen to that:<br />
He will get hence from Padua to-night,<br />
And that is well.&nbsp; You are very wise, Lord Justices,<br />
And yet you are not half so wise as I am,<br />
And that is well.<br />
O God! how I have loved you,<br />
And what a bloody flower did Love bear!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Comes back to the
table</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">What if I drank these juices, and so ceased?<br
/>
Were it not better than to wait till Death<br />
Come to my bed with all his serving men,<br />
Remorse, disease, old age, and misery?<br />
I wonder does one suffer much: I think<br />
That I am very young to die like this,<br />
But so it must be.&nbsp; Why, why should I die?<br />
He will escape to-night, and so his blood<br />
Will not be on my head.&nbsp; No, I must die;<br />
I have been guilty, therefore I must die;<br />
He loves me not, and therefore I must die:<br />
I would die happier if he would kiss me,<br />
But he will not do that.&nbsp; I did not know him.<br />
I thought he meant to sell me to the Judge;<br />
That is not strange; we women never know<br />
Our lovers till they leave us.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Bell begins to toll</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou vile bell,<br />
That like a bloodhound from thy brazen throat<br />
Call&rsquo;st for this man&rsquo;s life, cease! thou shalt not
get it.<br />
He stirs&mdash;I must be quick:&nbsp; [<i>Takes up cup</i>.]<br
/>
O Love, Love, Love,<br />
I did not think that I would pledge thee thus!</p>
<p>[<i>Drinks poison</i>, <i>and sets the cup down on the table
behind her</i>: <i>the noise wakens</i> <span
class="smcap">Guido</span>, <i>who starts up</i>, <i>and does not
see what she has done</i>.&nbsp; <i>There is silence for a
minute</i>, <i>each looking at the other</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">I do not come to ask your pardon now,<br />
Seeing I know I stand beyond all pardon;<br />
Enough of that: I have already, sir,<br />
Confessed my sin to the Lords Justices;<br />
They would not listen to me: and some said<br />
I did invent a tale to save your life;<br />
You have trafficked with me; others said<br />
That women played with pity as with men;<br />
Others that grief for my slain Lord and husband<br />
Had robbed me of my wits: they would not hear me,<br />
And, when I sware it on the holy book,<br />
They bade the doctor cure me.&nbsp; They are ten,<br />
Ten against one, and they possess your life.<br />
They call me Duchess here in Padua.<br />
I do not know, sir; if I be the Duchess,<br />
I wrote your pardon, and they would not take it;<br />
They call it treason, say I taught them that;<br />
Maybe I did.&nbsp; Within an hour, Guido,<br />
They will be here, and drag you from the cell,<br />
And bind your hands behind your back, and bid you<br />
Kneel at the block: I am before them there;<br />
Here is the signet ring of Padua,<br />
&rsquo;Twill bring you safely through the men on guard;<br />
There is my cloak and vizard; they have orders<br />
Not to be curious: when you pass the gate<br />
Turn to the left, and at the second bridge<br />
You will find horses waiting: by to-morrow<br />
You will be at Venice, safe.&nbsp; [<i>A pause</i>.]<br />
Do you not speak?<br />
Will you not even curse me ere you go?&mdash;<br />
You have the right.&nbsp; [<i>A pause</i>.]<br />
You do not understand<br />
There lies between you and the headsman&rsquo;s axe<br />
Hardly so much sand in the hour-glass<br />
As a child&rsquo;s palm could carry: here is the ring:<br />
I have washed my hand: there is no blood upon it:<br />
You need not fear.&nbsp; Will you not take the ring?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>takes ring and kisses
it</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Ay! gladly, Madam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And leave Padua.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Leave Padua.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">But it must be to-night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">To-night it shall be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, thank God for that!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">So I can live; life never seemed so sweet<br />
As at this moment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Do not tarry, Guido,<br />
There is my cloak: the horse is at the bridge,<br />
The second bridge below the ferry house:<br />
Why do you tarry?&nbsp; Can your ears not hear<br />
This dreadful bell, whose every ringing stroke<br />
Robs one brief minute from your boyish life.<br />
Go quickly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay! he will come soon enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Who?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>calmly</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Why, the headsman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No, no.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Only he<br />
Can bring me out of Padua.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You dare not!<br />
You dare not burden my o&rsquo;erburdened soul<br />
With two dead men!&nbsp; I think one is enough.<br />
For when I stand before God, face to face,<br />
I would not have you, with a scarlet thread<br />
Around your white throat, coming up behind<br />
To say I did it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Madam, I wait.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No, no, you cannot: you do not understand,<br
/>
I have less power in Padua to-night<br />
Than any common woman; they will kill you.<br />
I saw the scaffold as I crossed the square,<br />
Already the low rabble throng about it<br />
With fearful jests, and horrid merriment,<br />
As though it were a morris-dancer&rsquo;s platform,<br />
And not Death&rsquo;s sable throne.&nbsp; O Guido, Guido,<br />
You must escape!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Madam, I tarry here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Guido, you shall not: it would be a thing<br />
So terrible that the amazed stars<br />
Would fall from heaven, and the palsied moon<br />
Be in her sphere eclipsed, and the great sun<br />
Refuse to shine upon the unjust earth<br />
Which saw thee die.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Be sure I shall not stir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span> [<i>wringing her
hands</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">Is one sin not enough, but must it breed<br />
A second sin more horrible again<br />
Than was the one that bare it?&nbsp; O God, God,<br />
Seal up sin&rsquo;s teeming womb, and make it barren,<br />
I will not have more blood upon my hand<br />
Than I have now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>seizing her hand</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span> [<i>tearing her hand

<p class="poetry">Die for me?&mdash;no, my life is a vile
thing,<br />
Thrown to the miry highways of this world;<br />
You shall not die for me, you shall not, Guido;<br />
I am a guilty woman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Guilty?&mdash;let those<br />
Who know what a thing temptation is,<br />
Let those who have not walked as we have done,<br />
In the red fire of passion, those whose lives<br />
Are dull and colourless, in a word let those,<br />
If any such there be, who have not loved,<br />
Cast stones against you.&nbsp; As for me&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Alas!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>falling at her
feet</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">You are my lady, and you are my love!<br />
O hair of gold, O crimson lips, O face<br />
Made for the luring and the love of man!<br />
Incarnate image of pure loveliness!<br />
Worshipping thee I do forget the past,<br />
Worshipping thee my soul comes close to thine,<br />
Worshipping thee I seem to be a god,<br />
And though they give my body to the block,<br />
Yet is my love eternal!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<span class="smcap">Duchess</span>

<p class="poetry">Sweet, lift up<br />
The trailing curtains that overhang your eyes<br />
That I may look into those eyes, and tell you<br />
I love you, never more than now when Death<br />
Thrusts his cold lips between us: Beatrice,<br />
I love you: have you no word left to say?<br />
Oh, I can bear the executioner,<br />
But not this silence: will you not say you love me?<br />
Speak but that word and Death shall lose his sting,<br />
But speak it not, and fifty thousand deaths<br />
Are, in comparison, mercy.&nbsp; Oh, you are cruel,<br />
And do not love me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Alas!&nbsp; I have no right<br />
For I have stained the innocent hands of love<br />
With spilt-out blood: there is blood on the ground;<br />
I set it there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet, it was not yourself,<br />
It was some devil tempted you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span> [<i>rising
suddenly</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">No, no,<br />
We are each our own devil, and we make<br />
This world our hell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Then let high Paradise<br />
Fall into Tartarus! for I shall make<br />
This world my heaven for a little space.<br />
The sin was mine, if any sin there was.<br />
&rsquo;Twas I who nurtured murder in my heart,<br />
Sweetened my meats, seasoned my wine with it,<br />
And in my fancy slew the accursed Duke<br />
A hundred times a day.&nbsp; Why, had this man<br />
Died half so often as I wished him to,<br />
Death had been stalking ever through the house,<br />
And murder had not slept.<br />
But you, fond heart,<br />
Whose little eyes grew tender over a whipt hound,<br />
You whom the little children laughed to see<br />
Because you brought the sunlight where you passed,<br />
You the white angel of God&rsquo;s purity,<br />
This which men call your sin, what was it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay!<br />
What was it?&nbsp; There are times it seems a dream,<br />
An evil dream sent by an evil god,<br />
And then I see the dead face in the coffin<br />
And know it is no dream, but that my hand<br />
Is red with blood, and that my desperate soul<br />
Striving to find some haven for its love<br />
From the wild tempest of this raging world,<br />
Has wrecked its bark upon the rocks of sin.<br />
What was it, said you?&mdash;murder merely?&nbsp; Nothing<br />
But murder, horrible murder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, nay, nay,<br />
&rsquo;Twas but the passion-flower of your love<br />
That in one moment leapt to terrible life,<br />
And in one moment bare this gory fruit,<br />
Which I had plucked in thought a thousand times.<br />
My soul was murderous, but my hand refused;<br />
Your hand wrought murder, but your soul was pure.<br />
And so I love you, Beatrice, and let him<br />
Who has no mercy for your stricken head,<br />
Lack mercy up in heaven!&nbsp; Kiss me, sweet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No, no, your lips are pure, and mine are
soiled,<br />
For Guilt has been my paramour, and Sin<br />
Lain in my bed: O Guido, if you love me<br />
Get hence, for every moment is a worm<br />
Which gnaws your life away: nay, sweet, get hence,<br />
And if in after time you think of me,<br />
Think of me as of one who loved you more<br />
Than anything on earth; think of me, Guido,<br />
As of a woman merely, one who tried<br />
To make her life a sacrifice to love,<br />
And slew love in the trial: Oh, what is that?<br />
The bell has stopped from ringing, and I hear<br />
The feet of armed men upon the stair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span> [<i>aside</i>]</p>
<p class="poetry">That is the signal for the guard to come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

Here in thine arms, kissing thy mouth: farewell!</p>

Which would find utterance.</p>

Why have you not left a drop for me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No, no, it held but death enough for one.</p>

<p class="poetry">Is there no poison still upon your lips,<br />
That I may draw it from them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Why should you die?<br />
You have not spilt blood, and so need not die:<br />
I have spilt blood, and therefore I must die.<br />

Who said that?&nbsp; I forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

Who will love you, and not murder for your sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You need not die for that.</p>

<p class="poetry">Ah, if we die together, love, why then<br />
Can we not lie together in one grave?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">A grave is but a narrow wedding-bed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">It is enough for us</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And they will strew it<br />
With a stark winding-sheet, and bitter herbs:<br />
I think there are no roses in the grave,<br />
Or if there are, they all are withered now<br />
Since my Lord went there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ah! dear Beatrice,<br />
Your lips are roses that death cannot wither.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, if we lie together, will not my lips<br />
Fall into dust, and your enamoured eyes<br />
Shrivel to sightless sockets, and the worms,<br />
Which are our groomsmen, eat away your heart?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I do not care: Death has no power on love.<br
/>
And so by Love&rsquo;s immortal sovereignty<br />
I will die with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">But the grave is black,<br />
And the pit black, so I must go before<br />
To light the candles for your coming hither.<br />
No, no, I will not die, I will not die.<br />
Love, you are strong, and young, and very brave;<br />
Stand between me and the angel of death,<br />

<p class="poetry">I will kiss you,<br />
When you have thrown him.&nbsp; Oh, have you no cordial,<br />
To stay the workings of this poison in me?<br />
Are there no rivers left in Italy<br />
That you will not fetch me one cup of water<br />
To quench this fire?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">O God!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You did not tell me<br />

Nothing but fire.</p>

<p class="poetry">O Love!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Send for a leech,<br />
Not him who stanched my husband, but another<br />
We have no time: send for a leech, I say:<br />
There is an antidote against each poison,<br />
And he will sell it if we give him money.<br />
Tell him that I will give him Padua,<br />
For one short hour of life: I will not die.<br />
Oh, I am sick to death; no, do not touch me,<br />
This poison gnaws my heart: I did not know<br />
It was such pain to die: I thought that life<br />

<p class="poetry">Guido, why are we here?&nbsp; I think this
room<br />
Is poorly furnished for a marriage chamber.<br />
Let us get hence at once.&nbsp; Where are the horses?<br />
We should be on our way to Venice now.<br />
How cold the night is!&nbsp; We must ride faster.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>The Monks begin to chant
outside</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Music!&nbsp; It should be merrier; but grief<br
/>
Is of the fashion now&mdash;I know not why.<br />
You must not weep: do we not love each other?&mdash;<br />
That is enough.&nbsp; Death, what do you here?<br />
You were not bidden to this table, sir;<br />
Away, we have no need of you: I tell you<br />
It was in wine I pledged you, not in poison.<br />
They lied who told you that I drank your poison.<br />
It was spilt upon the ground, like my Lord&rsquo;s blood;<br />
You came too late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet, there is nothing there:<br />
These things are only unreal shadows.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Death,<br />
Why do you tarry, get to the upper chamber;<br />
The cold meats of my husband&rsquo;s funeral feast<br />
Are set for you; this is a wedding feast.<br />
You are out of place, sir; and, besides, &rsquo;tis summer.<br />
We do not need these heavy fires now,<br />
You scorch us.<br />
Oh, I am burned up,<br />
Can you do nothing?&nbsp; Water, give me water,<br />
Or else more poison.&nbsp; No: I feel no pain&mdash;<br />
Is it not curious I should feel no pain?&mdash;<br />
And Death has gone away, I am glad of that.<br />
I thought he meant to part us.&nbsp; Tell me, Guido,<br />
Are you not sorry that you ever saw me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I swear I would not have lived otherwise.<br />
Why, in this dull and common world of ours<br />
Men have died looking for such moments as this<br />
And have not found them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Then you are not sorry?<br />
How strange that seems.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">What, Beatrice, have I not<br />
Stood face to face with beauty?&nbsp; That is enough<br />
For one man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Why, love, I could be merry;<br
/>
I have been often sadder at a feast,<br />
But who were sad at such a feast as this<br />
When Love and Death are both our cup-bearers?<br />
We love and die together.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Oh, I have been<br />
Guilty beyond all women, and indeed<br />
Beyond all women punished.&nbsp; Do you think&mdash;<br />
No, that could not be&mdash;Oh, do you think that love<br />
Can wipe the bloody stain from off my hands,<br />
Pour balm into my wounds, heal up my hurts,<br />
And wash my scarlet sins as white as snow?&mdash;<br />
For I have sinned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span></p>
<p class="poetry">They do not sin at all<br />
Who sin for love.</p>

<p class="poetry">No, I have sinned, and yet<br />
Perchance my sin will be forgiven me.<br />
I have loved much</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
